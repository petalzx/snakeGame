# snakeGame
This is a classic game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. The game is implemented in Java and developed using IntelliJ IDEA. The snake must avoid colliding with the walls or its own body, as this will result in game over. The player can use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake. As the snake eats more food, it becomes longer and the game becomes more challenging. Can you beat the high score? Give it a try and see how far you can go!
